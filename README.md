# random-recipe

this is a webapp that lets you take any url to a recipe you like and save it into a collection
then from that collection you can take out a random one to make that day at the press of a button

it uses ogp to create a nice embed of the page showing a picture of the recipe and its description
if the website you linked didn't have the proper tags in place it will only display its url

the `proxyserver.js` file is a way to circumvent cors requests to a webpage pass through it first
